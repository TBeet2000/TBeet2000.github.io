			<h3>Quantum model of bistable perception</h3>
				<p>Summer research project conducted during my second/ third year of my undergraduate program.</p>
				<p>This research project explored the development of an experimental method to test a quantum model of non-stationary bistable perception applied to a Lissajous curve.</p>
				<p>The model in question makes use of the quantum Zeno effect, where by the evolution of a quantum state can be 'frozen' with repeated measurements (i.e. observations), to allow a particular observation of the bistable perception to remain visable until observation is forcfully cut.</p>

			<h3>Quantum State Transfer</h3>
			<p>Suppose we have a quantum state that holds some information that needs to be processed elsewhere. E.g. The state is in memory and a (Quantum)CPU needs to access said information, how can we get the state there?</p>
			<p>Quantum mechanics tells us that we cannot copy the state over there, so we are going to have to 'move it' instead. My research here looks into how to best 'move' said state. </p>
